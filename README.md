## 👋 Hi, I'm Alec!

### 🛠️ About Me
I'm a developer with a strong background in app development. I've done quite a bit of iOS, but I've also worked on web development and data-intensive Python apps in a professional capacity. 

### 🚀 What I Do
- **iOS Development:** I've built quite a few iOS applications. As part of App Team Carolina, I've designed a curriculum to teach the basics of SwiftUI. I've built countless user interfaces and hooked up innumerable APIs, and I've enjoyed every minute of it!
- **React Development:** I've worked extensively on React projects, ranging from a web-based camera scanning app to an AWS Lambda-backed chatbot. 
- **Python Programming:** I'm a major contributor to the open-source project **dMRIPlayground**, which is built with a Python back-end and Vue.js front-end.

### 👨‍🏫 Teaching & Mentorship
I have the privilege of teaching iOS Development at **App Team Carolina**, a student-run app development organization at the University of North Carolina (UNC). I've designed and led dozens of workshops to teach all the basics of UI design and data flow with SwiftUI. Many of my repositories are demo apps I created for these workshops 😎

### 🔬 Research Software Development
I contribute to the development of research software at the **Neuro Image Research and Analysis Labs (NIRAL)** at UNC. My work includes developing and maintaining the **dMRIPLayground**, a pipelined data processing platform designed for advanced neuroimaging research.

### ☁️ AWS Expertise
I'm also well-versed in Amazon Web Services (AWS), which I've used to develop scalable, serverless APIs for a Fortune 500 company.
